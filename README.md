Boykomet
====================================================

This is intended to be something like a reskinning of the game [Angry Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds) with Bulgarian politicians that need to be thrown away. To emphasise and explain this need, their quotes would be included from the [Bulgarian version of Wikiquote](https://bg.wikiquote.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%BE_%D0%91%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2).

The idea was inspired by the Bulgarian first lady at the time, that in October 2010 [tweeted](https://bivol.bg/firstlady.html) about prime minister Boyko Borissov:
"What we need is not a Boykometer, we need a Boyko-thrower. To send him far far away, and let those poor people work out how to handle him". Now, almost a decade later, Borissov, a [communist protege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyko_Borisov#Early_life) and [alleged criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyko_Borisov#Allegations_of_corruption_and_connections_with_organized_crime) is still in power.

The implementation is based on [Phaser Demo Game - Crazy Birds](https://github.com/nixsolutions/demo-phaser-crazybirds) by nixsolutions.

Further documentation is available in Bulgarian in the [concept document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i27Hsxnfu54dyp9ykNLZqtWY4lRPJKb3CiyQVx2srpk/edit#).

Implementation
--------------

Three parallel and long-living branches are planned:

* development - technological developments that could potentially be merged back into the original Crazy Birds project as a sign of gratitude.
* design - the specific changes, related to the reskinning of the game. This would most probably depend on tech changes.
* master - as usually, the stable and culuminative end result of the development.
